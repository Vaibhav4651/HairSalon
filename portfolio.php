                <p class="p1">Hair Stylists work in salons and barbershops, and perform services <br>like shampooing, trimming, cutting, blow drying and other styling. They must always be up-to-date on the most current hair styles and trends so they can make recommendations to clients about which styles will best suit their facial structure and hair type. It’s vital that they build ongoing relationships with clients and are always on top <br>of their customer service game. Additionally, Hair Stylists need to have some experience with making clients feel comfortable, which <br>is especially important when it comes to working with young children.</p>
